        <h1> Welcome to a Food Tour through Queens</h1>
        <p>
            Queens is the largest and most diverse borough in New York City, with a food scene to match.
            One of the great joys of living there is being able to sample
            dishes from around the world by simply hopping on and off the 7 train.
            Highlighted on this map is a full day of Queens food - from breakfast
            to dessert. 
        </p>

        <h3>Joe's Steam Rice Roll</h3>
        <h4>136-21 Roosevelt Ave # A1, Flushing, NY</h4>
        <p>
            We begin our journey at Joe's Steam Rice Roll in Flushing, NY.
            While there are several great spots to grab a quick breakfast in Flushing, 
            Joe's (in my opinion) stands out as the best rice roll in NYC.
            For first timers, I'd recommend going with either the roast pork or shrimp. 
            More adventurous eaters might also enjoy the curry fish ball. 
            They do not have a website, but you can find their full menu on <a href="https://www.yelp.com/menu/joes-steam-rice-roll-%E7%9F%B3%E7%A3%A8%E8%85%B8%E7%B2%89%E7%8E%8B-flushing" target="_blank">Yelp</a>.

        <h3>Mariscos El Submarino</h3>
        <h4>8805 Roosevelt Ave, Queens, NY 11372</h4>
        <p>
            For lunch we head over to where Corona meets Jackson Heights at Mariscos El Submarino.
            Specializing in seafood, your options here mostly consist of either ceviches or aguachiles. 
            I prefer the aguachiles, particularly the "mixto rojo" which includes a combination of shrimp, fish, 
            and octopus. Once again, we turn to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mariscos-el-submarino-jackson-heights" target="_blank">Yelp</a> to find their full menu.

    <section id="dinner">
        <h3>Angel</h3>
        <h4>7414 37th Rd, Queens, NY 11372</h4>
        <p>
            Dinner is just a few blocks away at Angel, an Indian restaraunt in the heart of Jackson Heights.
            It is hard to explain why Angel is better than the other Indian restaraunts in the area, but it just is. 
            Unlike others in the area, it has vegetarian, vegan, and meat options, the biryani baked in naan is just outrageous, 
            and anything involving their homemade paneer is fantastic. 
            Their full menu can be found on their website <a href="https://angelindianny.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <section id="dessert">
        <h3>Al-Sham Sweets and Pastries</h3>
        <h4>24-39 Steinway St, Queens, NY 11103</h4>
        <p>
            For dessert, we must unfortunately venture beyond the reach of the 7 train, 
            but it is well worth it. Tucked into the far end of Astoria's Little Egypt on Steinway Street, 
            Al-Sham has in my humble opion the best baklava in New York City and by extension the entire USA. 
            Smaller, less syrup-y, and with a higher nuts-to-pastry ratio than its Greek counterpart found in 
            the rest of Astoria, it is truly sensational. Visitors should also grab a slice of warm knafeh for a bit of variety. 
            The knafeh is best enjoyed immediately, while the baklava travels well and stays fresh for a couple of days.
